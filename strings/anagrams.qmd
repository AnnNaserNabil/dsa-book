# Anagrams and Frequency Counting

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Key Concepts

### 1. What Makes Two Strings Anagrams?
- Same length
- Same frequency of each character
- Different order of characters

### 2. Common Approaches

#### a) Sorting Approach
```python
def is_anagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    return sorted(s) == sorted(t)
```
- Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting
- Space Complexity: O(n) for storing sorted strings

#### b) Frequency Counting with Hash Map
```python
def is_anagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False
        
    freq = {}
    for char in s:
        freq[char] = freq.get(char, 0) + 1
    
    for char in t:
        if char not in freq or freq[char] == 0:
            return False
        freq[char] -= 1
    
    return True
```
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1) [since the size of the character set is fixed]

### 3. Variations of Anagram Problems
1. Group Anagrams
2. Find All Anagrams in a String
3. Valid Anagram with One Edit
4. Palindrome Permutation
5. Permutation in String

## Example: Group Anagrams

```python
def group_anagrams(strs):
    anagrams = {}
    for word in strs:
        key = tuple(sorted(word))
        if key not in anagrams:
            anagrams[key] = []
        anagrams[key].append(word)
    return list(anagrams.values())
```

## Common Pitfalls
1. Not considering case sensitivity
2. Not handling whitespace correctly
3. Forgetting to check string lengths first
4. Not considering Unicode characters

## Practice Problems

2. [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)
3. [Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)
4. [Permutation in String](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/)
5. [Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-steps-to-make-two-strings-anagram/)

## Optimization Tips
1. For lowercase English letters, use a fixed-size array of size 26 for frequency counting
2. For Unicode characters, use a dictionary/hash map
3. Early termination when string lengths differ
4. For multiple anagram checks, consider pre-processing the strings
