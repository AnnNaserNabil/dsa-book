# Linked Lists: Connecting the Dots

Linked Lists were where I first felt like a "real" programmer. Pointers everywhere!
 
 **My realization:** It's all about not losing your way. Always keep a reference to where you're going before you let go of where you are. And **always** use a dummy node.

## Types of Linked Lists

### 1. Singly Linked List
- Each node points to the next node
- Last node points to null
- Operations: insert/delete at head/tail, search, reverse

### 2. Doubly Linked List
- Each node has pointers to both next and previous nodes
- Allows traversal in both directions
- More memory but more operations flexibility

### 3. Circular Linked List
- Last node points back to the first node
- Can be singly or doubly linked
- Useful for round-robin type operations

## Time Complexity

| Operation | Time Complexity |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Access    | O(n)            |
| Search    | O(n)            |
| Insertion | O(1) - at head/tail with pointer |
| Deletion  | O(1) - at head/tail with pointer |
|          | O(n) - at arbitrary position |

## Common Operations

### Node Definition (Python)
```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
```

### Traversal
```python
def traverse(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.val)
        current = current.next
```

### Insertion at Head
```python
def insert_at_head(head, val):
    new_node = ListNode(val)
    new_node.next = head
    return new_node
```

### Deletion by Value
```python
def delete_node(head, val):
    dummy = ListNode(0, head)
    prev, current = dummy, head
    
    while current:
        if current.val == val:
            prev.next = current.next
        else:
            prev = current
        current = current.next
        
    return dummy.next
```

## Common Patterns
1. Two Pointers (Fast & Slow)
2. Dummy Node for Head Modifications
3. Reversing a Linked List
4. Finding the Middle Node
5. Detecting Cycles

## Practice Problems
1. [Reverse a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
2. [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
3. [Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)
4. [Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)
5. [Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)

## Tips for Interviews
1. Always check for edge cases (empty list, single node, etc.)
2. Use dummy nodes to simplify head modifications
3. Draw diagrams for complex pointer manipulations
4. Consider recursive solutions for certain problems
5. Be careful with pointer assignments to avoid losing references
