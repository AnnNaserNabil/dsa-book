## Why I Wrote This

For the longest time, Data Structures and Algorithms felt like a black box to me. I would stare at LeetCode problems, completely blanking out, or memorize solutions without truly understanding the *why*.

This "book" is my attempt to change that. It's not just a textbook; it's a collection of my personal notes, the patterns I've discovered, and the strategies that finally made things click. I wanted to document my journey from confusion to clarity, in the hope that it might help you too.

## My Learning Path

I didn't learn everything at once. I took it one step at a time, building my mental models layer by layer. Here is the path I followed:

1.  **[The Mindset Shift](intro.qmd)**: How I learned to love problem-solving.
2.  **[Arrays: The Foundation](arrays/index.qmd)**
    *   Mastering the [Two Pointers](arrays/two-pointers.qmd) dance.
    *   Seeing through the [Sliding Window](arrays/sliding-window.qmd).
3.  **[Strings: More Than Text](strings/index.qmd)**
    *   Unraveling [Anagrams](strings/anagrams.qmd) and patterns.
4.  **[Linked Lists: Connecting the Dots](linked-lists/index.qmd)**
5.  **[Stacks & Queues: Controlling Flow](stacks-queues/index.qmd)**
6.  **[Trees: Branching Out](trees/index.qmd)**
7.  **[Graphs: The Big Picture](graphs/index.qmd)**
8.  **[Sorting & Searching: Finding Order](sorting-searching/index.qmd)**
9.  **[Dynamic Programming: Breaking It Down](dynamic-programming/index.qmd)** (The beast I finally tamed!)

## How I Use These Notes

Instead of dry theory, I focus on:
- **Intuition over Rigor**: I care more about understanding *how* it works than proving it mathematically.
- **Visuals**: I draw diagrams because code can be hard to read.
- **Patterns**: I look for common templates that solve multiple problems.

## Join the Journey

This is a living document. As I learn new things and solve new problems, I'll add them here.

If you're reading this, I hope these notes serve as a friendly companion on your own journey. You don't need a PhD to be good at this—just curiosity and a bit of persistence.

*Let's get coding.*
