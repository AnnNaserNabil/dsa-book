## Two Pointers Pattern

The two pointers technique is an efficient way to solve problems involving arrays or linked lists where you need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints.

### When to Use
- When dealing with sorted arrays (or a sorted sequence)
- When you need to find a pair of elements in an array that meet certain criteria
- When you need to compare each element of an array to the other elements in some way

### Common Problems
1. Pair with Target Sum
2. Remove Duplicates
3. Squaring a Sorted Array
4. Triplet Sum to Zero
5. Dutch National Flag Problem

### Example: Pair with Target Sum

```python
def pair_with_target_sum(arr, target_sum):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = arr[left] + arr[right]
        if current_sum == target_sum:
            return [left, right]
        if current_sum < target_sum:
            left += 1  # Need a pair with a bigger sum
        else:
            right -= 1  # Need a pair with a smaller sum
    return [-1, -1]
```

### Time Complexity
- O(n) time | O(1) space, where n is the number of elements in the array

### Practice Problems
1. [Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)
2. [3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)
3. [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

### Tips
1. The array must be sorted for the standard two-pointer approach
2. Can be combined with other patterns like sliding window
3. Works well with linked lists for cycle detection and finding middle elements
