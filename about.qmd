# About Me

## Hi, I'm Ann Naser Nabil! 👋

I'm a software engineer on a mission to demystify Data Structures and Algorithms. Like many of you, I used to find DSA intimidating. It felt like a secret code I wasn't cool enough to understand.

But I realized that it's not about being a "genius"—it's about patterns, practice, and persistence.

## Why This Blog?

"My DSA Journey" is my personal digital garden. It's where I document what I learn, not just the "what" but the "how" and the "why". 

I created this resource because I wanted to move away from dry, academic textbooks and create something that feels like a conversation. Here, you'll find:

*   **My Personal Notes**: The explanations that finally made concepts click for me.
*   **Struggles & Breakthroughs**: Honest accounts of what I found hard and how I overcame it.
*   **Practical Patterns**: The templates I use to solve problems efficiently.

### My Philosophy

**"Don't memorize, visualize."** 

I believe that if you can draw it, you can code it. My goal is to build a visual intuition for every data structure and algorithm.

## Let's Connect!

I'd love to hear from you. Whether you have a question, a suggestion, or just want to say hi!
